## Quick Start
1. Read `orchestrator-agent.md` to understand the phases and roles.
2. Apply specialized agents as needed (quality, security, testing, performance, docs).
3. Use `BMAD-USAGE-EXAMPLE.md` for ready-to-run prompts and workflows.

## Conventions
- Prefer `.md` for agent docs to enable rich rendering.
- Keep sections consistent across agents: Identity, Mission, Operations, Deliverables.
